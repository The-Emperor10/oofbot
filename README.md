# Oofbot
Oofbot is a discord bot written in Rust. This is **not** meant to be used by other people, rather as an example of how to create a discord bot using [serenity-rs](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/) and several other libraries. Feel free to copy and paste my spaghetti code, or use it as an reference for your own bot.

Keep in mind this bot is hardcoded to interact with certain users and guilds in a certain way, so don't just clone this and run it and expect it to work.
